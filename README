The basic aim is to get app data from scraping/crawling play store.

We have two files here:
   1. get_all_app_ids.rb
   2. app_details_from_app_id.rb
which are our main scripts

get_all_app_ids.rb -
	From a file that contains the developer IDs, we are scraping the play store and fetching all the apps by that developer, and the total number of apps for that developer.
	We are just storing the (dev-id, app-id) pairs in a file, and (dev-id, #apps by that dev) in another file.


app_details_from_app_id.rb -
	Now we have app ids and dev ids. We are scraping/crawling the play store for app details given an app id.
